A. INTRODUCTION

This Agreement governs your use of Arise’s services (“Services” – e.g., and where available, the Arise mobile application, subscription features, workout plans, tracking features, personalized health recommendations, and any other in-app services) through which you can access, use, or subscribe to content, tools, and features (collectively, “Content”). Content may be offered through the Services by Arise or a third party. Our Services are available for your use in your country or territory of residence (“Home Country”). By creating an account for use of the Services in a particular country or territory, you are specifying it as your Home Country. To use our Services, you need compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required), and internet access (fees may apply). Our Services’ performance may be affected by these factors.

B. PAYMENTS, SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND REFUNDS

Some Services and Content may be provided for free, while others may require payment, either as a one-time purchase or as a subscription (“Paid Content”). Each transaction for Paid Content is an electronic contract between you and Arise, and/or you and any entity providing Content through the Services. Payments may be processed directly through the App store platform or via third-party payment processors.

You may be required to provide payment information, including credit or debit cards, Apple Pay, or other payment methods accepted by the Services. By providing payment information, you authorize Arise to charge you for Paid Content, including any applicable taxes, and to store your payment information securely for future transactions.

If your primary payment method fails for any reason (e.g., insufficient funds, expired card), you authorize Arise to attempt to charge your other eligible payment methods in order. Paid Subscriptions automatically renew until cancelled. You will be notified if the price of a Paid Subscription increases, and, if required, your consent will be requested to continue. Refunds for Paid Content, if any, are governed by the policies displayed during the purchase or subscription process. All transactions are final unless otherwise required by law.

C. ACCOUNT

Using our Services may require an Arise account (“Account”). Your Account is personal, and you are responsible for maintaining its confidentiality and security. You are solely responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, including any unauthorized access.

You must be at least thirteen (13) years of age (or the equivalent minimum age in your Home Country) to create an Account. Accounts for users under the minimum age can only be created with parental or legal guardian consent.

You may designate a Legacy Contact for your Account, who may access certain information in accordance with the procedures described on Arise’s support resources.

D. PRIVACY

Your use of the Services is subject to Arise’s Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your personal information. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully. Among other things, the Privacy Policy covers:

H. DOWNLOADS AND DATA BACKUP

Some Services allow you to download or export Content to your devices. You may be limited in the amount of Content you can download, and some downloaded Content may expire after a specified period. Certain Content may not be available for download or export.

You may redownload previously acquired Content to devices linked to your Account. Content may be removed or become unavailable if Arise loses the rights to make it available. You are encouraged to back up your data regularly.

Family Sharing allows certain subscriptions or Content to be shared among eligible family members, up to six (6) users. Organizers are responsible for all purchases or subscriptions made by family members using shared payment methods.
